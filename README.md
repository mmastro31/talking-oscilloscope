Description:
Talking Oscilloscope is a Senior Design Project built by Matteo and Ale. The goal of the project is to build an oscilloscope accesible to the blind and visually impaired (BVI).
An oscilloscope is a deice used to view oscillations, voltage or current through an external display attached to a circuit.
The project aims to create a device with haptic and audio feedback for the user. 



Inspiration:
There are not many accessible utilities for BVI electrical engineers. Inspiration included useful devices like a talking voltmeter and talking calipers.
